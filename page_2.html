			<h1>Street Markings</h1>
			<p>These spray painted street markings can often be seen around Wellington. There appears to be a colour-coded system for gas, water, electricity, internet and telecommunications. Internet and telecommunication related markings are usually purple.</p>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_0.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Chorus Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Presumably the Chor in this marking refers to the company <a href="https://www.chorus.co.nz/">Chorus</a>. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_1.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Unlabelled Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> I could not find out what this marking means. It is similar to the previous marking, but lacks writing. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_2.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Unlabelled marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Again, I couldn't find out what the marking meant. It is similar to the previous one, but without the top line. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_3.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Unlabelled Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> This marking has even less detail still. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_4.png">
			<h3 class="caption">2XD Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Again the meaning is a mystery, but I noticed quite a few markings that had a number followed by XD. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_5.png">
			<h3 class="caption">No Chor</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Again, I would assume the Chor here refers to <a href="https://www.chorus.co.nz/">Chorus</a>. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_6.png">
			<h3 class="caption">3XD Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption">This marking is similar to many of the others, but has the number 3.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_7.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Chor F.O 10XD</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Again it makes sense that Chor here refers to Chorus. It is likely that F.O stands for "Fibre Optic" referencing the <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/355136/what-is-fiber-internet-and-how-is-it-different/">fibre optic internet</a> network that is being rolled out around the country. </p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_8.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Chorus Marking 1XC</h3>
			<p class="caption"> Once again this probably refers to Chorus. This time the marking says XC instead of XD that we have seen in other examples.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="content">
			<img src="img/marking_9.png">
			<h3 class="caption">Citylink Marking</h3>
			<p class="caption"> <a href= "https://www.citylink.co.nz/contact-us">Citylink</a> markings seem to be far less common than Chorus ones. This marking was found in the Wellington CBD and probably has something to do with Citylink's fibre network. This marking was white rather than all the other markings, which were purple.</p>
